# drun

A FreeDesktop XDG Desktop Entry menu and launcher.



## Dependencies

To launch a desktop entry, `drun` uses [dex](https://github.com/jceb/dex) by default.

Alternatives (such as `gtk-launch`, `exo-open`, `kioclient`) could be used instead by customizing `drun-executable` and `drun-executable-opts`.
