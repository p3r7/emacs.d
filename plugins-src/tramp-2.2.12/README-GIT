                     Tramp Git usage instructions

The Tramp version number is in the `AC_INIT' macro in `configure.ac',
everywhere else it is generated from this macro.  You should update
this version number whenever you make a release.  After that, you need
to call `make configure' (or `autoconf --trace=AC_INIT' if you've
cleaned up the Makefile).  The version number looks like "X.Y.Z" where
X is the major revision, Y is the minor revision, and Z is a patch
level.

Tramp versions which are not released yet have a version number
"X.Y.Z-pre" in Git, with Z being the next patch level to be released.

Together with each version "X.Y.Z" there should be a Git tag "V-X-Y-Z"
so that each released version can be identified.

Maybe someday the version number should be auto-generated from the
Git tag name so that you don't have to maintain the version number
three times.

A Tramp version X.Y, which is regarded as stable, is maintained in a
Git branch "branch-X-Y-stable".  Those Tramp versions don't get new
features but just bug fixes.  Ususally, the Git HEAD is not based on
such a version but a higher one.

Tramp exists in three incarnations.  The Git tree on Savannah is the
main version, but there is also a copy in XEmacs packages repository
and a copy in the Emacs distribution.  Typically, these downstream
versions are based on, or identical to, an earlier stable version from
Savannah.

When Git is not installed locally, the master branch of Tramp can be
downloaded via the script "download.sh".

TODO: explain how to get the main version into XEmacs and into Emacs.
