Tramp stands for `Transparent Remote (file) Access, Multiple
Protocol'.  This package provides remote file editing, similar to
Ange-FTP and EFS.

The difference is that Ange-FTP uses FTP to transfer files between the
local and the remote host, whereas Tramp uses a combination of `rsh'
and `rcp' or other work-alike programs, such as `ssh'/`scp'.

On GNU Emacs, this version of Tramp uses a unified filename syntax for
Tramp and Ange-FTP.  Read the manual for details.
